This mini project is a Color Scheme Generator that lets users pick a color and choose a color harmony mode (like monochrome, complement, or triad). 
When the user clicks the button, the app fetches a matching color palette from The Color API and displays both the color blocks and their hex codes. 
Each color block and hex label can be clicked to copy the hex value to the clipboard, with a quick “✔ Copied” message as feedback.
It’s a simple project that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while practicing how to use APIs, event listeners, and the Clipboard API to create an interactive and user-friendly tool
